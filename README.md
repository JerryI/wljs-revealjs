## Making slides using Markdown

```

The output can be projected into a separate window for the convinience. 

## Merging slides from a different cells
To merge the all slides into a single fat presentation use

```markdown
.slides

```
It will merge and print slides from all cells in the notebook into a single one.

## Embed Wolfram Language
The real power comes, if you are using __[WLX addon](https://jerryi.github.io/wljs-docs/wlx)__, which is shipped as a separate plugin [wljs-wlx-support](https://github.com/JerryI/wljs-wlx-support) allowing you to write in WL language XML-like style

*first cell*
```mathematica
Figure = Plot[x, {x, 0, 1}];
```

*second cell*
```markdown
.slide

# Embedded Wolfram

<TextString><Now/></TextString>

Or even some graphics, like

<div style="text-align: center">
    <Figure/>
</div>
```
